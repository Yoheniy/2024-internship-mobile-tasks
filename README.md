                        Dart Basic - Building eCommerce Application
Create a simple command-line eCommerce application using Dart. This application will allow users to add, view, edit, and delete products. Products should have a name, description, and price.  The application should use OOP principles to organize the code and manage the product data.

Product Manager Class: Create a class that manages products and includes the following methods:
Add a new product

Task Verification
Create a Repository: Create a repository named ‘2024-internship-mobile-tasks’. We will use this repository for submitting all internship phase tasks.
Create a Folder: Inside the repository, create a folder named ‘on-boarding’.
Project Naming: Create your project inside the ‘on-boarding’ folder and name it based on the product number. Since this product is the second one, name the project folder as ‘product-2’.
